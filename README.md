PayPesapal SDK
The PayPesapal SDK is a Python library that facilitates seamless integration with Pesapal for payment processing in your projects. This SDK simplifies the process of generating access tokens, setting up Instant Payment Notification (IPN) URLs, and initiating payment requests through Pesapal's API.

Features
Access Token Generation: Easily generate access tokens required for authentication with Pesapal.
IPN Setup: Register IPN URLs to receive notifications about payment status.
Payment Requests: Initiate payment requests by providing necessary details and retrieve payment URLs.

Usage
Initialization
To use the SDK, import the PayWithPayPesapal class:
from paypesapal import PayWithPayPesapal

# Create an instance of PayWithPayPesapal
pay_with_pesapal = PayWithPayPesapal()
Initiating a Payment
Use the paysapal_payment_request method to initiate a payment request:
# Initiate a payment request
payment_response = pay_with_pesapal.paysapal_payment_request(
    amount=100,  # Set the payment amount
    email_address="user@example.com",  # Customer's email address
    phone_number="+1234567890",  # Customer's phone number
    first_name="John",  # Customer's first name
    last_name="Doe"  # Customer's last name
)

# Extract the payment URL for redirection
payment_url = payment_response.get("redirect_url")

Handling Payment Response
Once the payment is initiated, the redirect_url obtained from the response can be used to redirect the user to the payment page.
# Redirect the user to the payment page
# (Implementation depends on your web framework or application)
# Example: Redirect in Flask
from flask import redirect

@app.route("/initiate_payment")
def initiate_payment():
    # ... (payment initiation code)
    return redirect(payment_url)

Handling IPN Notifications
Set up the IPN URL to receive payment status notifications:
# Set up IPN URL
notification_id = pay_with_pesapal.register_ipn_and_extract_id(access_token)
# Use the obtained notification_id as required in your application
